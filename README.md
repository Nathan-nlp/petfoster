# petfoster
This is a web-based pet fostering platform that I participated in developing. 
It adopts a front-end and back-end separation architecture. The front-end is built using Vue.js and vanilla JavaScript, while the back-end is developed with the Spring Boot framework and MySQL as the database.
The system is divided into three main modules: a user module, an administrator module, and a merchant module.
